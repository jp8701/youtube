# youtube-homepage

This is an exercise for the Odin Project HTML/CSS Course. The goal was to recreate a YouTube page and put to practive working with images and videos.

This page is using mostly the Grid and Flexbox to layout the content.

This is not fully responsive and there are a few spacing issues to fix.
